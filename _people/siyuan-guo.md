biography: "Siyuan is a PhD student, supervised by Ferenc Huszár and Bernhard Schölkopf under Cambridge-Tübingen Fellowship.
Her research interests lie at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning. 
She is interested in making AI more robust through developing new techniques for training neural networks such that they can learn the invariant causal structure behind the data.
Previously, she studied Machine Learning (MSc) at UCL and Mathematics (BA + MSc) at Cambridge. She also worked as a quantitative strategist in finance."
